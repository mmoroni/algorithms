# Algorithms and Data structures

Classic algorithms and datastructures

This repository is not intended to be used in prod, but for educational purposes.

Reading STL or other production libraries are hard, specially when you are trying to learn the algorithm as they try to deal with many specific cases and language specifics + optimizations.

If you plan to contribute, please keep in mind that.

Thanks and contributions are more than welcome!
